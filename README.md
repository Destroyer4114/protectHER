<a href="https://hack36.com"> <img src="http://bit.ly/BuiltAtHack36" height=20px align="right"> </a>

## Problem:
 - Exponential increase in Female-targeted crimes
 - Apps currently available cannot provide direct evidence needed by security officials or are too difficult to use.
 - Due to a lack of strong evidence, most criminals usually go unpunished in most cases.

## Idea Description:
We provide two-way communication between the one who witnesses the crime, victim or spectators, and the security officials directly. The key idea behind solution is that women’s safety isn’t just a matter for them or their immediate family, but a shared responsibility among all.

**protectHER** : The User side client

Using the application, the victim or witness of the crime will be able to record and upload audio, video as well as their location in real time. All the information is sent securely to the database in real time.

**SOS-safeOsecure**: The Police side client

SOS enables a security officer to identify the location, act, and graphic, if any, of crime. An IP address received from protectHER can be entered into SOS to securely access all the data received.
